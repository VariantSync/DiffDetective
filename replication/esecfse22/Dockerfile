# syntax=docker/dockerfile:1
# ----------------------------
# This template sets up a Docker container using a multi-stage build and Alpine Linux.
# Alpine is a Linux-based OS embedded systems making it one of the smalles Docker images. It should be used if possible.
# The multi-stage build consists of two stages: The compile stage, and the environment preparation stage.
#
# The compile stage only installs the packages required to compile the source files of the prototype. The generated binaries
# are then copied to the environment during the environment preparation stage.
#
# The environment preparation stage is responsible for installing all dependencies and copying all files that are required
# to execute the Docker container.
#
# This template contains the commands that are required to compile and execute a Java prototype.
#
# Lines commented as `REQUIRED` should only be altered/removed if you know what you are doing.
# Lines commented as `EXAMPLE` contain commands that probably have to be adjusted
