# Haskell Formalization

This is a Haskell stack project that implements the extended formalization of our theoretical concepts from our paper _"Classifying Edits to Variability in Source Code"_.
A detailed explanation and comparison to our formalization in the paper is given in our [appendix](../appendix/appendix-esecfse22.pdf).

**Hardware and software requirements** are described in [REQUIREMENTS.md](REQUIREMENTS.md).

**Build instructions** are given in [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md).
