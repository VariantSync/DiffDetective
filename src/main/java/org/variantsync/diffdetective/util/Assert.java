/**
 * Assertions which cannot be disabled.
 *
 * <p>Assertions should document preconditions and postconditions which aren't enforced by the type
 * system. All assertions in this class throw {@code AssertionError} to abort the program
 * execution. At no point an {@code AssertionError} should be catched and the normal control flow
 * resumed. The only valid reasons to catch such an exception is to add additional information to
 * the exception or to ensure a fast and correct program shutdown.
 *
 * <p>The default Java assertions are disabled by default which makes them unsuitable for this
 * research project because correctness is a higher goal then a little performance. This class
 * provides assertions in a similar manner as JUnit and should be used for all assertions outside
 * of unit tests (for unit tests use JUnit's assertions). Disabling or Enabling Java's
 * {@code assert} should make no difference whatsoever.
